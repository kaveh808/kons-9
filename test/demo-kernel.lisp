(in-package #:kons-9)

#|
Greetings and welcome to kons-9!

These demos assume that you have succeeded in loading the system and opening
the graphics window. If you have not, please check the README file.

Make sure you have opened the graphics window by doing:

(in-package :kons-9)
(run)

The demos below will walk you through some of the features of the software. You
will evaluate the expressions in each demo and the graphics in the window will
update accordingly.

We also assume that you are familiar with the basics of 3D graphics.

As of this writing, kons-9 runs on MacOS (Intel & M1), Linux. and Windows.

We hope you find the system enjoyable and useful.

(Demo 06 kernel) transforms and hierarchies ====================================

Hierarchies are implemented by SHAPE and SHAPE-GROUP classes, both of which have
a TRANSFORM.

#|
(Demo 07 kernel) shape-groups ==================================================

Create a shape-group by creating shapes at specified points.
|#

  (add-shape *scene* (scatter-shapes-in-group (lambda () (make-cube 0.5))
                                              (make-grid-points 3 3 3 (p! -2 -2 -2) (p! 2 2 2)))))

#|
(Demo 08 kernel) animation =====================================================

The simplest way of doing animation is to add an ANIMATOR to the motions of a 
scene. The animator will call its setup function (if it has one) when the scene
is initialized, and will call its update function every frame.

To play animation, hold down space key. Notice the frame counter updating in the
status bar at the bottom of the window. By default the scene starts at frame 0
and ends at frame 240.

Press '[' key to reset the scene back to frame 0.

This animation translates the shape in the X axis direction.
|#
(with-clear-scene
  (let ((shape (add-shape *scene* (make-cut-cube 2.0))))
    (add-motion *scene*
                (make-instance 'animator
                               :setup-fn (lambda () (translate-to shape (p! 0.0 0 0)))
                               :update-fn (lambda () (translate-by shape (p! 0.1 0 0)))))))

#|
(Demo 09 kernel) multiple animators ============================================

Animate all the leaf shapes in a group by the same amount.

Hold down space key to play animation. Press '[' key to go back to frame 0.
|#
(with-clear-scene
  (let ((group (add-shape *scene* (scatter-shapes-in-group
                                   (lambda () (make-cube 0.5))

                                              :test #'is-leaf?))))))

#|
(Demo 10 kernel) shape-animator ===============================================

The previous example animated all the shapes by the same amount.
A SHAPE-ANIMATOR allows us to store and use per-animator data in an association
list. It also takes a SHAPE to animate.

Here each shape is rotated by a different random amount around the Y axis.

Hold down space key to play animation. Press '[' key to go back to frame 0.
